        <h2>Welcome to Treat Code - the sweetest corner of the internet!</h2>

        <p>I'm thrilled to share my passion for baking and tech with you. My journey began in Indiana, 
            where I grew up and eventually pursued my dreams in computer science. As a tech enthusiast, 
            I know the importance of keeping my coding skills sharp, and many in the software world are familiar with LeetCode 
            - a platform for honing coding abilities. Inspired by this, I decided to create Treat Code, 
            a home bakery specializing in delightful macarons.</p>

        <br>

        <p>During the challenging times of the pandemic in March 2020, I turned to baking as a creative outlet. 
        I discovered my love for making macarons and have dedicated myself to perfecting these delectable treats 
        ever since. Each macaron is crafted with care, infused with unique flavors that will leave your taste buds 
        dancing with joy.</p>

        <br>

        <p>As of now, the menu features an array of mouthwatering macaron flavors, and I'm excited to introduce new additions 
        like cake pops, fudge, chocolate-dipped strawberries, and more in the near future. My commitment to quality 
        and flavor drives me to create treats that not only look delightful but also taste absolutely heavenly.</p>

        <br>

        <p>Whether you have a special event coming up or simply want to indulge in a moment of sweet bliss, head over to our 
        menu or order tab to place your order. I can't wait to personally connect with you and create delicious memories 
        through Treat Code.</p>

        <br>

        <p>Thank you for joining me on this sweet adventure. Let's make life a little sweeter together!</p>

                <br>
                My interest in macarons peaked when I had them in Indianapolis, IN. Where I went to college. I spent 
                weeks perfecting my standard macaron recipe and feel confident that they are the best version yet. 
                Attempting a multitude of flavors and fillings has brought a whole new level of challenge and fun to the 
                macaron making process. Please get with me to order, ask questions, suggest flavors, and more!
